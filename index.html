                <p>Suzie & Jake celebrated their wedding in the Gold Coast hinterland. With flowers sourced from the Brisbane Rocklea Markets, using natives and fragrant local roses, the wild flowing bouquet perfectly complimented Suzie's simple white dress.</p>

          <p>My name is Emma, i'm a florist from Melbourne.</p>

          <p>I am passionate about sustainability and using local flowers. I beleive that floristry is showcasing what nature has to offer, so in return I think we should take care of our natural world.</p>

          <p>I am also completely foam free in my floral designs. Floral foam is a common product used in weddings and events, but has consequences on our planet, and our health.
